Hibernate
I learned how to connect hibernate with java and while using the sql database to create a session. Most of what I learned was from Rachel Yancey's discussion during our team meeting. She showed us a tutorial of how it works and the template that she used to run her program. Altogether the main function of hibernate is to map Java classes to database tables. In order to map these classes with the database tables is implemenet them with an XML file.

This week I was able to complete setting up Java Eclipse and following the professors video's in order to push my code onto github.

My team has decided to complete some extra topic presentations in order to help us decide what app/coding project we wish to complete.
I am unsure where to start for building a personal web app of mine which is a password manager, I was hoping for a little input since I have no clue where to begin and my coding skill are less than satisfactory.

Next week for my team I will be presenting on both:
Client and Server Sockets - Stevan Lewis 
Use Case Document - Stevan Lewis
